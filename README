	~ INFANT STAR ~

A game not quite made in three days by Sheridan Kane Rathbun.

As of September 16th, 2013 this project has been abandoned. However, a very significant portion of the code written for this project is being used in a brand new project. Stay tuned for more info on that.

------ ARGUMENTS ------

To load maps other than the included testmap.imp, you must supply an argument to the game executable at the command line.

Ex: game junkhouse.imp

The above command starts the game and loads the junkhouse.imp level from the "maps" directory.

Dragging and dropping map files onto the executable file in windows will *not* work!

------ CONTROLS ------

The following are the controls used to play the game:

Arrows		-	Move
Left Ctrl		-	Jump
Left Alt		-	Attack
Escape		-	End game
